    <h1>About Us</h1>
    <p>
      Boomger is a modern dating application built for people who value
      intention, authenticity, and real-world connection. We believe meaningful
      relationships are not created by endless swiping alone, but by shared
      context, genuine interaction, and proximity that makes connection possible
      beyond the screen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unlike traditional dating platforms that prioritize volume and superficial
      matches, Boomger is designed to help users connect with purpose. We focus
      on quality over quantity by encouraging thoughtful profiles,
      location-aware discovery, and community-driven interactions that reflect
      how relationships naturally form in everyday life.
    </p>
    <p>
      Boomger goes beyond one-on-one matching. Through location-based
      communities and interest groups, users can meet others who share similar
      lifestyles, values, or activities within their area. Whether it’s
      discovering someone nearby, joining a local group, or starting a
      conversation that feels natural, Boomger bridges the gap between digital
      dating and real-life connection.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our mission is simple: to create a safe, inclusive, and intentional space
      where meaningful relationships can grow. Whether you’re looking for
      companionship, friendship, or a long-term relationship, Boomger is built
      to help you connect with people who truly fit your world.
    </p>
    <p>
      Boomger isn’t just about finding someone—it’s about finding the right
      connection, at the right place, at the right time.
